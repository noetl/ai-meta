# Current Memory

## Active Focus

- Maintain cross-repo orchestration quality and consistency.
- Keep submodule pointers aligned with merged upstream changes.
- Keep release/distribution workflows reproducible.
- Track and drive fixes for Jira bug set `AHM-4280..AHM-4284` mirrored to `noetl/noetl` issues `#261..#265`.
- Enforce NoETL release commit subject format without scope braces (`fix: ...`, not `fix(scope): ...`) so automation triggers.
- Keep GCP project context explicit: `noetl-demo-19700101` is operated under Adiona.org organization context.

## Recent Compaction

- None yet.

## Open Items

- Sync Jira ticket summaries and acceptance criteria into GitHub issues `#261..#265`.
- Start implementation branches and PRs for each mirrored bug once reproduction details are confirmed.
